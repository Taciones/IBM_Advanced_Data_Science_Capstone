Check the presentation file to check all the work done.

Bassicaly created one model to help identify the price for a rent in one appartment in SÃ£o Paulo city.
Then created one API to consume this model and show the user the preddicted price.

For the future I want to deploy this API on IBM Cloud, so user can access it anywhere.
